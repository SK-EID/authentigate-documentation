E-services can integrate Authentigate to: Authenticate users with strong, legally recognized eID solutions Access verified attributes such as name, age, date of birth, and personal code Implement age-based access controls (e.g. “over 18”) Comply with legal and sector-specific requirements Authentigate is designed to be easy to integrate, secure by design and scalable to meet the needs of both public and private sector service providers across multiple countries.

Authentigate - A service developed by SK to offer attribute storage, calculation and sharing functionalities, allowing for the secure and controlled exchange of user information during authentication. RP (Relying Party) - An organization or service that utilizes the SK authentication gateway service to authenticate its users and verify their age. OIDC (OpenID Connect) - A protocol used for central authentication, facilitating secure user verification and attribute sharing. The Authentigate service supports two endpoints for initiating authentication: Authorization endpoint (/authorize), using POST or GET request after which the user is redirected to login service at OIDC_SERVICE/login. Pushed Authentication Request, PAR (/par) where Authentigate service validates the POST request and responds with a URI for starting authentication. Regardless of authentication flow, the Authentication Request MUST include all required parameters (per parameter, this may vary depending on the flow used - this is highlighted in the table below). Including non-required parameters is optional. Authentigate supports both signed and unsigned Authentication Requests. For passing request parameters as JWT, request parameter must be used (see Signed Authentication Request). Authentication Request parameters: Parameter Required Value Description scope Yes Must contain 'openid'. Supported scopes can also be retrieved from /.well-known/openid-configuration [1] Static value required by OIDC core protocol and additional user information relying party needs. Values separated by spaces. age_comparator No (Yes, when scope includes age_over or age_under) Integer Specifies against which age should comparison be made response_type Yes Must be 'code' The authorization code flow is used client_id Yes Relying-party ID A pre-registered relying-party identifier redirect_uri Yes (No, in case of signed request) Relying-party callback URL A pre-registered relying party callback URL state Yes (No, in case of signed request) Unique random string RP generated opaque value used to maintain state between the request and the callback. Can be used to mitigate replay and CSRF attacks nonce No Unique random string RP generated unique string. If provided, will be returned as a nonce claim in the id_token. Can be used to mitigate replay attacks ui_locales No Must be one of et, en, lv, lt (or multiple in order of importance, separated by spaces) End-User’s preferred language for authentication. Determines the language used on the login page. The first found match with supported values will be set as the app language. If not set (or none are supported), app tries to determine the UI language from browser data etc. and defaults to 'en' if detection fails. code_challenge No (Yes, in case of basic authentication) Base64 encoded hash of a unique challenge. Base64 encoded hash of a unique challenge. The code-challenge is created by SHA256 hashing the code_verifier and base64 URL encoding the resulting hash Base64UrlEncode(SHA256Hash(code_verifier)). You can view an example from https://tonyxu-io.github.io/pkce-generator/. NB! Must be present if not using JWT authentication. code_challenge_method No (Yes, in case of basic authentication) Must be 'S256'. The algorithm by which the challenge shall be verified on the server side. Must be present if client 'code-challenge-required' is true or if not using JWT authentication. sid_confirmation _message No String with information for users for the SID authentication app Free text (max length 200 characters) value shown to Smart-ID users in the app during code choice. This can be the name of your service or provide more detailed info about the current interaction (like users name or order number etc). mid_confirmation _message No String with information for users for the MID authentication app Free text (max length 40 characters for 'GSM-7', 20 characters for 'UCS-2') value shown to Mobile-ID users before asking authentication PIN. mid_confirmation _message_format No Must be one of GSM-7, UCS-2 Specifies which characters and how many can be used in 'mid_confirmation_message'. GSM-7 allows 'mid_confirmation_message' to contain up to 40 characters from standard GSM 7-bit alpabet including up to 5 characters from extension table ( ´+€[]^|{}\\ +´) . UCS-2 allows up to 20 characters from UCS-2 alpabet (this has all Cyrillic characters, ÕŠŽ šžõ and ĄČĘĖĮŠŲŪŽ ąčęėįšųūž). acr_values No Space separated string containing one or more of the following values: http://eidas.europa.eu/LoA/high, http://eidas.europa.eu/LoA/substantial, mid, mid_ee, mid_lt, sid, sid_ee, sid_lv, sid_lt, idcard, idcard_ee Optional value specifying authentication methods to be usable by the end-user. Order of provided values affects the presentation of authentication options to the end-user. Acr values that appear earlier will be prioritized. Example order: mid_lt mid_ee sid_lv sid_lt sid_ee - LT (MID, SID), EE (SID, MID), LV (SID). Please note that requesting authentication methods with LoA 'substantial' is supported but would result in error as all currently available authentication methods are recognized as 'high'. request No (Yes, if RP wishes to pass request parameters in JWT) Request parameters which the RP wishes to pass in a single, self-contained parameter Parameter representing the request as a JWT whose Claims are the request parameters 1 Supported scope values for requesting end-user attributes are as follows: Scope claim Description family_name Family name given_name First name birthdate Date of birth https://id.authentigate.eu/claims/name Full name https://id.authentigate.eu/claims/personal_code Personal identification code https://id.authentigate.eu/claims/eid_issuing_country Country code that has issued the personal identification code https://id.authentigate.eu/claims/age Actual age https://id.authentigate.eu/claims/age_under Verification of end-user being under certain age - if requested in scope, the parameter age_comparator must be provided in request https://id.authentigate.eu/claims/age_over Verification of end-user being over certain age - if requested in scope, the parameter age_comparator must be provided in request Request parameters can be passed also as JWTs by using the request parameter. This parameter represents the request claims as JWT (Request Object) whose claims are the request parameters. Any of the request parameters as in Authentication Request Parameters can be passed using the request parameter (the same conditions to authentication request parameters apply (required vs optional, value)). Note that response_type, client_id and scope MUST be included in the request root level. These MAY also be included in the JWT - in that case the values inside and outside JWT MUST match. On root level, the scope parameter MUST contain the openid scope value. If any parameter is included both outside AND inside JWT Request Object, the ones inside prevail when processed by authorization server. When passing authentication request in a signed JWT, the JWT own claims are: Claim Required Value iss Yes Must equal \"client_id\" sub Yes Must equal \"client_id\" aud Yes Must be authorization server /token endpoint jti Yes Unique JWT ID used for verifying one-time use of JWT exp Yes JWT expiration time; after passing JWT is not accepted iat No Time of JWT generation JWT example: { \"iss\": \"bank321\", \"sub\": \"bank321\", \"aud\": \"https://httpd-proxy\", \"iat\": 1747899848, \"exp\": 1747903448, \"jti\": \"e212513d-f78d-45a3-8834-d68db5f4c4c7\", \"client_id\": \"bank321\", \"scope\": \"openid age_over personal_code given_name family_name name birthdate\", \"response_type\": \"code\", \"redirect_uri\": \"https://httpd-proxy/tester/callback/\", \"state\": \"af0ifjsldkj\", \"nonce\": \"n-0S6_WzA2Mj\", \"code_challenge\": \"hKpKupTM391pE10xfQiorMxXarRKAHRhTfH_xkGf7U4\", \"code_challenge_method\": \"S256\", \"ui_locales\": \"et en\", \"acr_values\": \"mid_ee mid_lt sid idcard\", \"age_comparator\": \"18\" } Supported cryptographies in signed JWT: RS256, RSA using SHA-256. Authorization server validates JWT signature and payload fields on the JWT according to OpenID Connect specifications. Please note that using request_uri parameter is not supported! OIDC requests are initiated via PAR (pushed authentication request). For this, a POST request with parameters formatted with application/x-www-form-urlencoded using a character encoding of UTF-8 is sent to OIDC_SERVICE/par. See the request parameters described at Authentication Request Parameters. PAR flow authentication request, Example 1: Request person’s full name and a verification that the person is over 18 years old { \"response_type\": \"code\", \"client_id\": \"CLIENT_ID\", \"redirect_uri\": \"REDIRECT_URI\", \"state\": \"STATE\", \"nonce\": \"NONCE\", \"scope\": \"openid https://id.authentigate.eu/claims/name https://id.authentigate.eu/claims/age_over\", \"acr_values\": \"http://eidas.europa.eu/LoA/high\", \"age_comparator\": \"18\", \"code_challenge\": \"CODE_CHALLENGE\", \"code_challenge_method\": \"S256\", \"sid_confirmation_message\": \"FREETEXT\", \"mid_confirmation_message\": \"FREETEXT\", \"mid_confirmation_message_format\": \"GSM-7\" } PAR flow authentication request, Example 2: Request person’s given name, family name, and age { \"response_type\": \"code\", \"client_id\": \"CLIENT_ID\", \"redirect_uri\": \"REDIRECT_URI\", \"state\": \"STATE\", \"nonce\": \"NONCE\", \"scope\": \"openid https://eidas.europa.eu/attributes/naturalperson/FirstName https://eidas.europa.eu/attributes/naturalperson/FamilyName https://id.authentigate.eu/claims/age\", \"acr_values\": \"http://eidas.europa.eu/LoA/high\", \"code_challenge\": \"CODE_CHALLENGE\", \"code_challenge_method\": \"S256\", \"sid_confirmation_message\": \"FREETEXT\", \"mid_confirmation_message\": \"FREETEXT\", \"mid_confirmation_message_format\": \"GSM-7\" } Please pay attention that client id and client secret should be passed in Authorization header of /par request in a format that OAuth 2.0 foresees for client secret authorization method. According to OAuth 2.0 framework, Authorization header must be in the Authorization: Basic encodedString format, where the encodedString is a result of Base64 encoding of OAuth client’s clientID:clientSecret. The oidc-service shall validate the authentication request and respond with a URI that the public client can use to start authentication. Authentication request response example: HTTP/1.1 201 Created Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store Content-Type: application/json { \"request_uri\": \"urn:ietf:params:oauth:request_uri:8Tw6nn6BAvoHBS5VM7M1UvndAAHdM5\", \"expires_in\": 90 } Using the returned link, the app can open end-user’s browser with the corresponding url. The app should open the link with an external user agent as recommended by current OAuth2 for native clients best practices: GET /authorize?client_id=EinLKYAAMqPr2Tw &request_uri=urn:ietf:params:oauth:request_uri:8Tw6nn6BAvoHBS5VM7M1UvndAAHdM5 After this, the user is redirected to the login service (located at OIDC_SERVICE/login). After authentication, Token can be requested: see Token Request (/token) and Token Request Response OIDC requests are initiated via authorization endpoint. A POST or GET request with parameters formatted with application/x-www-form-urlencoded using a character encoding of UTF-8 is sent to OIDC_SERVICE/authorize. See the request parameters described at Authentication Request Parameters. POST request body example, requesting all scopes: { \"response_type\": \"code\", \"client_id\": \"CLIENT_ID\", \"redirect_uri\": \"REDIRECT_URI\", \"state\": \"STATE\", \"nonce\": \"NONCE\", \"scope\": \"openid\", \"acr_values\": \"http://eidas.europa.eu/LoA/high\", \"code_challenge\": \"CODE_CHALLENGE\", \"code_challenge_method\": \"S256\", \"sid_confirmation_message\": \"FREETEXT\", \"mid_confirmation_message\": \"FREETEXT\", \"mid_confirmation_message_format\": \"GSM-7\" } GET request with Query string example: OIDC_SERVICE/authorize?scope=openid&response_type=code&redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI&state=STATE&nonce=NONCE&code_challenge=CODE_CHALLENGE&code_challenge_method=S256 The user is redirected to the login service (located at OIDC_SERVICE/login). A standard HTTP 302 authentication response redirect is returned to the end-user if a successful authentication session exists. The redirect points user’s browser back to RP’s registered redirect_uri where the RP shall verify the value of the state parameter. Successful Response parameters: Parameter Required Value Description code Yes unique random string A single-use, client-bound, short-lived authorization code, that can be used at OIDC token endpoint to redeem the id-token. state Yes unique random string RP’s state parameter value specified in the Authorization Request redirect_uri Yes URL RP’s redirect_uri specified in the Authorization Request HTTP 302 response example: HTTP/1.1 302 Found Location: https://client.example.org/callback?code=GaqukjWp4vvzEWHnLW7phLlwkpB0 &state=WDm4nExm1ADHzIEwoPxQ0KjBwnnk6NIrq178fU4rBDU Unsuccessful response includes error, error description and state parameter value (must match with the value in request).

If token request is invalid, authorization server constructs the error response with HTTP response code 400. Token error response example: HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request Content-Type: application/json Cache-Control: no-store Pragma: no-cache { \"error\": \"invalid_grant\", \"error_description\": \"The provided authorization code is invalid, expired, revoked, does not match the redirection URI used in the authorization request, or was issued to another client.\" } If token request validation is successful, authorization server returns a an application/json media type response that includes ID token and access token. The ID token is a signed JWT that contains token claims, including the requested attributes of authenticated end-user. On authorization server side, the session expires in 60 seconds. Token response parameters: Parameter Value Description access_token Unique random string An opaque random string scope Requested scopes Scope values as requested expires_in Expiration time in seconds id_token JWT A serialized and signed JWT, including end-user claims requested in scope token_type Bearer Access token Type Token success response example: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: application/json Cache-Control: no-store Pragma: no-cache { \"access_token\": \"SlAV32hkKG\", \"token_type\": \"Bearer\", \"scope\": \"openid https://id.authentigate.eu/claims/age_under\" \"expires_in\": 3600, \"id_token\": \"eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZ...LrLl0nx7RkKU8NXNHq-rvKMzqg\" } The RP must validate the id_token signature and claims as specified in the OIDC core specification.
