= Testing

Authentigate offers two options for testing in the demo environment:

. Explore the user experience (UX/UI)
. Integrate your system for technical testing


== Option 1: View UX and UI in Demo Environment

Try out the Authentigate flow and user experience directly in your browser — no registration needed.

=== How to Try It

. Open the demo client page: https://oidc.demo.sk.ee/sample-rp/
. Set the parameters on the demo page:
.. **Scope** – select which attributes to request
.. **Age comparator** – used when `age_over` or `age_under` are selected
.. **Language** – choose your preferred language
.. **Demo client** – select the client setup to simulate:
... **alco123** – test age verification (e.g., for alcohol purchase)
... **bank321** – test authentication (e.g., for logging in)
. Choose an authentication method:

     Personal number (Lithuania): `50001029996`

.Example
[,text,subs="verbatim"]
----
     Mobile: `+37200000766`  
     Personal number: `60001019906`
----
. Start the authentication process. When the verification code appears, wait a few seconds — after successful authentication, you’ll be redirected to the demo client page.
